    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This project proposes a way of making appointments for visiting a prisoner. These
        appointments are made by the person who is visiting the individuals who are serving time
        in correctional facilities. The police officer
        who is responsible for them will accept or decline the appointment. The police
        officer will also be able to see the appointments that are made for the prisoner.
        After the visit, the visitor will make a summary of the visit. The summary will be about
        the time of the visit, the reason for the visit, the prisoner's health and if any objects
        were brought to the prisoner or the prisoner gave it to them.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Introducing our latest web application, a powerful and intuitive tool for managing visits for
        individuals who are serving time in correctional facilities. Our app streamlines the visitation
        process, making it easier and more efficient for both visitors and facility staff.
    </p>
    <p>
        With our web app, visitors can easily schedule and manage their visits, attaching important information
        about themselves and their relationship with the individual they are visiting. This includes their
        identity, photo and nature of their relationship (e.g. friend, family member, layer).
    </p>
    <p>
        The app also includes a comprehensive record-keeping system, tracking the date, nature, and duration of
        each visit, as well as any items or information exchanged during the visit. The app also allows visitors
        to document the state of health and well-being of the individual they are visiting, providing valuable insights
        into their condition and helping to ensure their overall well-being.

            process for individuals in correctional facilities as efficient and streamlined as possible.</li>
        <li><b>Improve record-keeping and reporting</b>: Another key goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive
            record-keeping and reporting system for visits. </li>
        <li>
            <b>Enhance overall well-being and quality of life</b>: Ultimately, the overarching goal of this project is to improve
            the overall well-being and quality of life for individuals in correctional facilities. By providing them with a
            reliable and convenient way to stay connected with loved ones and legal representatives.
