# DeAd-Web-Project :police_officer: :policewoman:

 :memo: A web application will be developed to manage the visits received by individuals convicted and serving sentences in a prison or correctional facility. Each visit will be associated with information about the visitor(s), including at least their identity, photograph, relationship with the convict (family member, legal guardian, lawyer, friend), and the purpose of the visit.

Additionally, the system will record the date of the meeting, its nature and duration (e.g., consultation regarding the appeal process, friendly visit), any objects or information provided to the convict or exchanged between the convict and the visitor(s), a summary of the discussions (if confidentiality is not violated), the health and mood of the inmate, and any witnesses present at the meeting. The implemented web system will generate statistics in HTML, CSV, and JSON formats, focusing on visits made per individual, time period, type of offense, or other criteria.
